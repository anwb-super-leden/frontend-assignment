# ANWB Applicant Assessment - Frontend

We'll use this assignment to gain insight into how you structure your code, what you're familiar with and how you reason about application architecture. It's important to note that this is _not_ a test and as such there is no way to pass or fail. Your focus should be on creating something that we can discuss later on and can serve as a solid starting point for an interview. If there's anything you get stuck on or that takes too much time, feel free to skip it!

## The assignment

In this repo you can find a data.json file that contains (somewhat random) data. Your task is to create a small and simple interface that contains the following:

1. an input field
2. a way for the user query the JSON data from the input field (either by submitting or otherwise)
3. a list of results

## Requirements

- You must use React
- You must fetch and use only the provided JSON data
- If using separate pages, use routing so that every page can be accessed by its own URL
- A simple layout that works on all major browsers and devices

## Nice to haves

- Use Styled Components
- Use solid state management
- Use Typescript (this will be important when working at ANWB)
  - Skip this if you're not familiar with Typescript. This is something you can learn when you start with us
- A way to filter the results

## Things to consider

- Goal of the project is to give us insight in what you know and are familiar with, and to give us something to openly discuss with you during the interview as you would with colleagues
- Feel free to perfect things if you're having fun, but we suggest not spending too much time on it
- Organized and structured code is paramount
